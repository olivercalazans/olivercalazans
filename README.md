### Hi, I'm Oliver.

More commonly known as Calazans. I'm pursuing a degree in computer networks technology because I find it quite interesting how information is transported and how servers operate. I aim to work in the field of Information Security, which was also one of the reasons I chose the networking course. I enjoy learning a lot, and I study extensively to improve my skills and learn new things. I am an avid reader, as books are one of the main sources through which I seek knowledge. I work as an English teacher in an elementary school, but I've also taught adults. Lately, I've been focusing more on developing my skills in Python and Linux, as they are widely used in the security field.

 - I work as an English teacher.
